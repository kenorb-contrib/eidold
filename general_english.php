<p>Students are involved in task-based activities, which help them to improve their actual use of English by doing and solving various tasks and problems.</p>

<p>We use the latest editions of English File, Cutting Edge, Inside Out and Headway coursebooks with accompanying DVDs, CDs, workbooks etc. and a library is available for extra materials. Students are provided with the textbook appropriate to their level for use during class time.</p>

<p>Class atmosphere is also important and students are encouraged to participate as much as possible in their lessons with many students making new friends along the way...in English, of course!</p></td>
