							<p>
							Hi everybody! My name is Elena and I am from Russia, actually I am from one of the coldest part of Russia – Siberia. I am a student of "English in Dublin", which is the best international school in Dublin. I was here for the first time in June of 2010 and now I am back again. I have to say that it\'s a good time, because the school gives you not just knowledge it gives to you a small part of Ireland. Lessons in the school have a unique structure, which consist of: grammar, writing, listening, reading, speaking and fun. I am never bored in the class. Always there is something new and interesting. The school is situated near parks, museums, art-galleries, shops and city-center. This perfect location gives you the opportunity not just to improve your level of the English language, but also to see the most beautiful views of Ireland. Well, if you are searching an international school for learning the English language in Ireland, "English in Dublin" would be your best choice! 
See you soon 
Elena

							<p> I\'m from Sao Paulo, Brazil. I\'m 42 years old; when I arrived here I was 38 years old.

I am leaving English in Dublin to go to university in Portugal to do a Master\'s degree in Communication law for 1 year.

I am a qualified lawyer and worked in the Catholic University, Sao Paulo, for 21 years.

I came here to learn English for 6 months, but…….I stayed 2 ½ years! After that, I went back to Brazil for 7 months and then came back again, because I love Ireland.

My first time here was in 1999, a long time ago, before the Euro. This is my second home.

See you soon Ireland!

<p>To describe my stay in Dublin in just one word: amazing! :-)
During the 9 weeks I spent in Ireland, I had a lovely host family, I met really nice people from the whole world and the school was perfect for me.
I also visited some places in the countryside of Ireland, very beautiful! 
All in all, it was one of the best experiences in my life and I\'ll never forget that time in Ireland.
Thanks to everybody!

I am not very good in speeches so I will be simple... Without doubts one of the best experiences in my life. I really enjoy interesting lessons and friendly classmates. Time I spend in Ireland is absolutely amazing not only in class but also outdoors, interesting sight places, excursions, new friends and the main - everything\'s in English so it\'s really getting better!

Abdelbast has completed a course in Sports Business Management Studies, in Coventry, UK.  He had a good level of English before arriving to Ireland but wanted to take a course with English in Dublin in order to brush up his English and learn some Irish expressions. </p>

<p>He joined the C1 class and studied at EID for 2 weeks.  His plan for his stay in Ireland is to do work placement in his line of business in order to get some experience in the sports management industry.  English in Dublin was recommended to him through an agent who is also organising his work placement. </p>
