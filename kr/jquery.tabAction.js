More than 1 million people a year are now using IELTS to enhance their career opportunities throughout the English-speaking world. IELTS is recognized by more than 6,000 organizations worldwide. The tests are available in more than 120 countries in over 500 locations, with test dates available up to four times a month.<br><br>These courses are designed for exam preparation, and it is assumed that students are already at, or very close to, the required standard of English. They focus on the format of the exam and the various types of exercises and questions it contains. Well-known Cambridge First Certificate and IELTS preparation textbooks are used as well as exam practice books and past papers.<br><br>Watch one of our teachers, Stephen Bruce, talk about the IELTS exam - why it\'s important, and why it\'s a good idea to attend the IELTS exam preparation courses.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a class="video_trigger" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClQqB1jg--c"><img src="../public/img/ielts8.png"></a></td><td><p>Leticia Pinhero Correa, aged 20, from Sao Paolo, Brazil, is celebrating an overall Grade 8 in the IELTs exam. Before coming to Dublin, Leticia was studying Biology at university and is now returning to completing her studies as she wants to work with animals, the environment and wildlife - in Africa!</p><p>Leticia arrived in Dublin on 16 April, 2009, she started learning English at A2 level, pre-intermediate, then progressed through the levels.</p> <p>She got a B in FCE in December 2009, and then she wanted to have the IELTS just to see how she would do and took the exam in April.</p><p>Leticia puts her exam success down to remaining calm under pressure but we think she made the very most of her time here.</p></td></tr><tr><td><img src="../public/img/student.jpg"></td><td><p>Stefania graduated in International Relations and Human Rights last November and I immediately started looking for an International Master in Europe that could suit me well. Unfortunately, at that time my English war very rusty and I feared I wouldn\'t be able to get the IELTS certificate that all European Universities require for the admission.</p><p>For this reason I decided to travel to Dublin and to stay there one month, in order to brush up on my English and to attend an IELTS course. I chose the "English in Dublin" School since it offers a full time IELTS course and amazing services (Internet connection, study rooms, flexible timetables, highly competitive prices and a central position).</p><p>The IELTS course at EID is a great opportunity for students like me who need a fast and intensive preparation: every day the course covers all the four parts of the IELTS exam (Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking), therefore all the students have the chance to deepen their knowledge on their soft spots and at the same time to keep practicing and improving their previously acquired skills.</p><p>The lessons are very well organised and highly interactive: the teacher gives space to every student and everyone can tell what he/she thinks about a certain topic. The atmosphere is very stimulating and educative because you deepen your knowledge by listening to different opinions and at the same time you get prepared for the IELTS.</p><p>Besides attending morning classes, I also tried to be always prepared and to improve my weak spots (Reading and Listening in particular) by practising alone a few hours per week, since my IELTS exam was due in a month\'s time.</p><p>My IELTS teacher has always been very helpful and supportive: everyday he gave me extra homework and some useful advice, he corrected all my writings and he taught me interesting methods to be successful. I finished my course on Friday and on Saturday I was sitting the IELTS exam at University College Dublin. The results were unbelievable: my overall band was 8! I was very surprised because I got great results precisely were I had to improve: 9 in the Reading and 8 in the Listening.</p><p>EID gave me a unique opportunity to improve my English in a wonderful international and challenging environment!</p></td></tr></table></div>';
