							In many places, to be a Native Speaker of English is the First 
							Qualification. Add to that a Degree and a TESOL Certificate, and you can walk into a job.
							Even with only one of these assets, you can often find work.
							Of course, people who are Bilingual are just as good as Native Speakers of English.

Before, we said, `Go West`. Now, we say, `Go East`.
Asia, as a whole, has about 60% of the world`s population. They ALL want to learn English.
If you prefer, you can still Go West, but, preferably, South-West to Central and South America.
