							<li>You submit your completed enrolment form along with details of any payments you have made.</li>

It is imperative that you have this in your possession at the airport.</li>
							<li>On your arrival at the school, you will complete the registration procedures. Please, be sure to bring your passport/ID with you on the first day.</li>
